# Delay-estimation visual working memory task

This is the matlab code repository for delayed-estimation visual working memory (TMVWM) project. The main contributor for this project is [Ru-Yuan Zhang](ruyuanzhang@gmail.com).

## History
* 2019/12/05, RZ saved all non-target color in a trial  
* 2019/10/25 RZ add 4 seconds response constraint, otherwise the trial will be added at the end.
* 2019/09/11 RZ fixed the bugs 
* 2019/07/01 RZ created the github repository


## Instructions of running experiments
### Preparation
* You should know your monitor physical size [height cm, width cm] and resolution [height px, widwth px].
* Please keep the view distance roughly 50cm.

### Running experiment
1. For each run, simply type below to run the experiment. It needs to input the number of stimuli (e.g., 1,3,6)

~~~matlab
>> VWM_rect_new_rz.m
Please input the number of stimuli: 3
~~~


2. Data will be automatically saved with time stamp.
